This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

NOTES ABOUT REDUX TERMs
1. store - it will hold the states of the application.
2. rootReducer -  it will have all reducers.
3. reducers - each reducers will return its own state. base on the actions, it will return the new state.
4. combineReducers - this method will merge all the reducers together and provide root state.
5. actions - actions are the methods which will be triggered to update/modify states.
6. dispatch - actions will be dispatched to reducers with the help of dispatch method.
7. provider - provider is a component given  by react-redux package, it should be the parent of the all componets in an application to have redux.
7. connect - it the method to connect a component to connect with store.
it will have 2 params,
    a. mapStateToProps:
       this method will be triggered after the state changes.
       store.getState() is its equivalent
    b. mapDispatchToProps 
       this is to merge actions into component props.
       store.dispatch is its equivalent
8. actionTypes - > these are the contants to define action type and used inside actions and reducer functions.
